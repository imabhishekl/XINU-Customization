Xinu Scheduler:
Description:
Xinu scheduler also knows highest priority scheduler schedules the highest priority process first.
Advantage:
Easy to implement and highest priority process are always given the prefernce to work which makes sure they are alwasy executed.
Disadvantage:
Starvation because highest priority process always get prefernce over lowest one even though the lowest priority thread was in the system for long time

Linux Scheduler:
Description:
Epoch is created with ready process but time as per priority
Advantage:
This scheduler makes sure all the process gets the time as per priority so low starvation but time is shared as per priority.
Disadvantage:
High computation over head because we need to compute the epoch every time it ends which is based on current ready process in queue.

Multi Level Queue:
Description:
Realtime process execute in a round robin fashion for that epoch
Advantage:
Real time process priority is high and low starvation as normal queue is also there for execution.
Disadvantage:
Distribution is depended on random number which should be proper for better selection of process and low starvation.
